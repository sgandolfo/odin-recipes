  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>The most iconic late-night Italian comfort food, spaghetti aglio, olio e peperoncino, is simplicity at its most satisfying.</p>
  <p>With a gentle heat and an irresistible aroma, it embodies the soul of home-style Italian cooking.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Spaghetti</li>
    <li>Chili Pepper</li>
    <li>Garlic</li>
    <li>Olive Oil/li>
    <li>Fresh Parsley</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Add spaghetti and cook until al dente. Reserve some of the pasta cooking water before draining</li>
    <li>While pasta cooks, thinly slice the garlic and chili peppers</li>
    <li>In a large skillet, gently heat the olive oil over low-medium heat. Add garlic and chili, letting them slowly release their flavor without burning. <em>(If garlic browns too quickly, remove the pan from the heat for a moment)</em></li>
    <li>Add the drained spaghetti to the skillet. Toss well, adding a splash of the reserved pasta water to help the oil coat the pasta evenly</li>
    <li>Plate up, garnish with chopped parsley if desired, and enjoy this simple yet soulful classic</li>
