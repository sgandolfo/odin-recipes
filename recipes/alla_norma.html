  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>The most iconic Sicilian pasta, Pasta alla Norma, is a celebration of sun-soaked Mediterranean flavors.</p>
  <p>With its vibrant colors and comforting richness, it embodies the warm, generous spirit of Sicilian cooking.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Short pasta <em>(traditionally macaroni, rigatoni, or penne)</em></li>
    <li>Eggplant</li>
    <li>Tomato passata <em>(or peeled tomatoes, crushed)</em></li>
    <li>Garlic</li>
    <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
    <li>Ricotta salata</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Cut the eggplant into medium cubes or slices. Sprinkle with salt and let rest in a colander for 30 to 40 minutes to draw out bitterness. Pat dry with kitchen paper</li>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Fry the eggplant until golden and soft. Remove and drain on kitchen paper.</li>
    <li>In the same pan (add a little more oil if needed), saut√© the garlic gently until fragrant. Add the tomato passata, season with salt, and let simmer for about 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in a few torn basil leaves</li>
    <li>In the meantime, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook pasta until al dente. Reserve a little pasta cooking water before draining</li>
    <li>Add the drained pasta to the tomato sauce, tossing well. If the sauce feels too thick, add a splash of pasta water. Stir in most of the fried eggplant, keeping a few pieces aside for garnish</li>
    <li>Plate the pasta, top with the remaining eggplant, generous shavings of ricotta salata, and fresh basil. Serve immediately</li>
  </ol>
